[TEST]
	Block falling collision test
	Player movement test


////////////////////////

Player Movement:
Left, Right = Movement
Down = Aim down
Up = Aim up
X = basic jump

////////////////////////
Physics:
	Edge case where the player is in the middle of the side of a falling block - player can jump off the the free side to be safe [automatic] (Mr Driller ref)

////////////////////////
Concept - The player controls a character that is a DJ miner, digging for vinyl records to collect (restores draining health)
	- Timer appears beside player that is a countdown (10 -> 0) for how long they have until they run out of health.


////////////////////////
Collectibles:
	Health (Record)
	Bomb (Walk into  to activate)
	1 UP
	Slow time (Beat Sweeper) ??? (Same as Burst?)
	Air Bubble (Stops health drain for a period of time)

Collectibles should be a type of block. This way they have consistant rules with how blocks are stacked and for gravity when a block beneath a collectible breaks and falls.
	
////////////////////////
Enemies?:
	Walk back and forth, makes disssonance music cue when hit by.


////////////////////////
Procedural Levels:
	MIDI influences what blocks are placed to chain combos?
	Health Items count, Bedrock count, how often colours are clumped together,	
	
////////////////////////
MIDI Parsed Data:
	int bpm = 160 (example) [BEATS PER MINUTE]
	int bps = 60 		[BEATS PER SECOND] (nned this since our game runs at 60 FPS to keep it consistant)
	float hbps = bps * 0.5 	[HALF BEATS PER SECOND] (Could be used to calculate how late or soon a note is hit)
	int lastHalfBeat = 0 	(stores the index of the last half-beat we passed)

We need to add latency when the track plays becuase it takes time to for the game to play the sound then travel to the speakers. 
(Very small number)

Questions:
How do we stop the player from rushing downwards?
- Forcing them to dig to the beat. This allows the Beat Sweeper (timeline) to destroy blocks before the screen moves down also.

Use A* to draw a line path to the nearest Collectible Pickup (Press R2 {Assist Button} to activate it) (Good way to implement and show A*)
We need to use A* to make sure there is a valid path from start to finish when making the level.

Is it possible to break a falling block from landing on you if you time the beat right?
(Can only break falling block/block above player if the beat is perfect (NOT fast/late)

How do we store the parsed MIDI data to be used?
We can store in a file format like .JSON that we can read from.

Block layout:
8 blocks horizontal, 12 blocks visible on a scrolling screen vertically.

How to tell if when the player has pressed the "Break" button that is in time with the music track?
That input when the button is released is sent to a function to check how in sync is it with the music 
by checking the track's BPM (Beats Per Minute), BPS (Beats Per Second). That way we can determine if it was 
late, early, perfect or missed. We always round the value to be closer to perfect for it to feel better
and incase inputs are dropped. The player shouldn't have to EXACTLY on time with the music for it to work.

How to tell if the player has missed a beat, or it was specifically late/early?
Different sound curs associated with the different types hit.
UI text that is present in the HUD that shows what type was hit/not hit (can be a pop UI element spawned near the player also).
Print out specific long range values in the cmd window to show the exact numbers [DEBUGGING]
