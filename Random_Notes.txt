[TEST]
	Block falling collision test
	Player movement test


////////////////////////

Player Movement:
Left, Right = Movement
Down = Aim down
Up = Aim up
X = basic jump

////////////////////////
Physics:
	Edge case where the player is in the middle of the side of a falling block - player can jump off the the free side to be safe [automatic] (Mr Driller ref)

////////////////////////
Concept - The player controls a character that is a DJ miner, digging for vinyl records to collect (restores draining health)
	- Timer appears beside player that is a countdown (10 -> 0) for how long they have until they run out of health.


////////////////////////
Collectibles:
	Health (Record)
	Bomb (Walk into  to activate)
	1 UP
	Slow time (Beat Sweeper) ??? (Same as Burst?)
	
////////////////////////
Enemies?:
	Walk back and forth, makes disssonance music cue when hit by.


////////////////////////
Procedural Levels:
	MIDI influences what blocks are placed to chain combos?
	Health Items count,		
	

////////////////////////
How do we stop the player from rushing downwards?
- Forcing them to dig to the beat. This allows the Beat Sweeper (timeline) to destroy blocks before the screen moves down also.
