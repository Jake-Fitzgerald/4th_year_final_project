Meeting (28/11/2025)
Idea is too simple and can't be used as the capstone project.
Instead try to focus on making something "complex"
-> Fully dive into MIDI
-> Complete MIDI parser
-> Music Visualiser?

-------------------------
Focus on music visualisation using MIDI. We can separate the individual instruments by their channels to correspond with the different visuals.
Kick Drum: Circle that pulses.
Hit Hat: Random coloured square that displays in a random position on screen (within a certain range).
Keyboard keys: Display along the screen horizontally.


[DEBUG]
BPM: Number string
BPS: Number string
